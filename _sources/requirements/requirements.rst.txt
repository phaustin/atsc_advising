Sample programs

Note that the official requirements for graduation are always given by the
UBC Academic Calendar for the year that you declared your major (although
when the requirements change you're welcome to match the later versions
of the program if you want).  For example you can
`click here <http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/archive/vancouver>`_ to see an
archive of all past calendars, 
`and then click here <http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/archive/vancouver/1112/index116d.html?tree=12,215,410,416>`_
to see the requirements for the ATSC B.Sc. for the 2011-2012 academic year.
