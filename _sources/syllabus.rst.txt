ATSC 500 - Boundary Layer Meteorology (3 credits)
=================================================


ATSC 500 - Boundary Layer Meteorology (3 credits) Fall 2019


**Instructor**: Prof. Phil Austin. paustin@eos.ubc.ca, Room 157
EOS Main

**Objectives**: To provide an understanding of the bottom two
kilometers of the atmosphere, a turbulent region known as the
atmospheric boundary layer.

**Text**: *Required*: `Stull BLM`_ : Stull, R.B., 1988:
*An Introduction to Boundary Layer Meteorology*. Kluwer

Academic Pub. (paperback). 666 pp. [abbreviation = BLM]

*Optional*: `Stull Practical`_ , R.B. Stull 2017:
*Meteorology for Scientists and Engineers*, 3rd edition


*Option*: Garratt, J. R., 1992: The atmospheric boundary layer.
Cambridge University Press, 316 pp. [abbreviation=ABL]


Assignments and Projects
------------------------

* We will be using python on the departmental high performance cluster (and your laptops) extensively.  No need to be an expert python programmer, but you will need some experience writing programs.  I'll have details/examples at our first meeting.

* The project will hopefully relate directly to research questions you'd like to answer.
