| **This option integrates academic study with relevant supervised work experience. The work placements are arranged by mutual agreement between the students and the employing organizations. Enrolment is limited. Admission is by application to the Science Co-op Office in February prior to third year. Selection will be based on previous academic performance and general suitability to the work environment as assessed by resumé and interview. Admissibility to a third-year Atmospheric Science Bachelor of Science specialization is prerequisite for admission to the Co-op Option but applicants can apply to Co-op before admission to the third-year atmospheric science specializations. Graduation from the Co-op program requires completion of four work terms, the normal courses required for the specialization.

1. **Articulation:**

A. Changes to existing courses: List all existing sending/receiving
   articulations and how they’ll be updated.

    (New lower-level courses must inform articulation committee and
    discuss potential articulation.)

1. **Budget Impact: **

A. New Courses: explain the resources necessary for the course and how
   the budget for new course will be accommodated within your academic
   unit.

1. **Library Impact:**

2. **Consultation With Other Academic Units: **

***Statement of Academic Integrity*:**

***NOTE: All instructors have been asked to include the following type
of statement of Academic Integrity in their course outlines distributed
to students.***

*The academic enterprise is founded on honesty, civility, and integrity.
As members of this enterprise, all students are expected to know,
understand, and follow the codes of conduct regarding academic
integrity. At the most basic level, this means submitting only original
work done by you and acknowledging all sources of information or ideas
and attributing them to others as required. This also means you should
not cheat, copy, or mislead others about what is your work. Violations
of academic integrity (i.e., misconduct) lead to the breakdown of the
academic enterprise, and therefore serious consequences arise and harsh
sanctions are imposed. For example, incidences of plagiarism or cheating
may result in a mark of zero on the assignment or exam and more serious
consequences may apply if the matter is referred to the President’s
Advisory Committee on Student Discipline. Careful records are kept in
order to monitor and prevent recurrences.*
