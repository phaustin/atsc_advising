A Platform for Student Projects
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

I would like to see student projects uploaded to a public website, as advertising for both the
students and ATSC.  It's now trivial to make a blog using IPython notebooks -- teaching the mechanics
of how to do this would only take 2-3 hours of class time.  Here is an example of
what I have in mind: both in terms of tool use and presentation format:

* `Nicolas Fauchereau blog entry <http://nicolasfauchereau.github.io/climatecode/posts/xray/>`_ using
  `Github pages <https://pages.github.com/>`_ and `IPython notebooks <http://ipython.org/notebook.html>`_

5. Collision-Coalescence
------------------------

**Numerical Modelling of Collision Coalescence Growth of Raindrops.**

1) Develop a numerical model for the falling speed of spherical
raindrops. Start off by reading whatever you can find on the web, using
the three links below as a starting point. Make the following
assumptions:

-  The drops are spherical.

-  The atmosphere is saturated.

-  A quadratic drag law is adequate.

It would be best to make drop radius an explicit model variable, and
more elegant to make the model equation(s) dimensionless. Once your code
is working, test it by comparison with known analytical solutions and
limiting cases.

2) Use the results of your model to investigate the rate of growth of
raindrops under collision coalescence. Make and justify assumptions
about atmospheric conditions, including drop size distribution. You
might want to start off by using only one drop size in a monodisperse
cloud layer.

Motivation:  How meteorologists can provide value in a world where forecasts are made by computer.

Learning Goals:  By the end of this project, you will be able to:

- compare the value of ensemble numerical forecasts vs deterministic forecasts

- explain how ensemble forecast output can be used to make probabilistic forecasts

- create scripts to postprocess raw ensemble forecasts into a calibrated probabilistic forecast

- verify probabilistic forecasts against weather-station observations

  a) precipitation forecasts into hydroelectric reservoir watersheds

11. Carbon sequestration of an unmanaged set-aside field in the Fraser Delta 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Set-aside areas are a ecological conservancy strategy in the Fraser
Delta to provide habitat for migratory birds. Although the ecological
benefits for migratory birds is well studies, is is also of interest
to explore whether those areas promote carbon sequestration
(i.e. whether such areas could qualify as a carbon offsetting
strategy). To answer this question, one needs to measure long-term CO2
exchange over such surfaces.

The UBC micrometeorology group has measured (as a by-product to an
energy balance study) carbon-dioxide (CO2) fluxes (net ecosystem
exchange, NEE) by eddy covariance continuously over a full annual
cycle over a set-aside grassland on Westham Island (see:
http://ibis.geog.ubc.ca/~achristn/infrastructure/westhamisland.html). The
student project's goal would be to properly filter, analyze and for
the first time to present data on CO2 fluxes, and consequently
C-sequestration over this specific grassland and estimate the annual
NEE.

Keywords: Biogeochemical cycling, carbon cycle, agricultural systems, eddy covariance

Requirements: High-level programming skills, time-series analysis, statistics

12. Aerodynamic resistances to heat and momentum transfer above an insect-attacked pine forest 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To properly model transfer of energy, water and greenhouse gases, many
land-surface schemes employed in weather and climate models rely on
resistance approaches. Those schemes calculate the resistances as a
function of wind and stability (See also
http://ibis.geog.ubc.ca/~mpb/).

A challenge in the resistance formulation is the fact that the
resistance to the transfer of momentum can be as much as an order of
magnitude less than for other entities, like heat and water
vapour. This is because in addition to skin drag momentum transfer
over rough surfaces includes form drag, due to bluff body
effects. Form drag includes vortices and wakes which add the transfer
of momentum by pressure perturbations. There is no parallel process
associated with the transfer of heat or water vapour.

The UBC micrometeorology and biometeorology groups have measured
momentum and sensible heat fluxes and profiles of wind and
temperatures over several weeks in a boreal forest, attacked by the
Mountain Pine Beetle. The current outbreak of mountain pine beetle in
British Columbia which began in the late 1990’s is predicted to kill
76% of the mature pine volume in the province by this year. Although
such epidemics have occurred in the past, none have been this large in
areal extent or in duration. Our goal is to properly model the effects
of the Mountain Pine Beetle on carbon, water and energy exchange. To
perform this task we need to check whether our current handling of
resistances is properly reflecting the nature of this attacked forest.

The student's project goal would be to calculate resistances and
parameterize the differences in resistance between heat and momentum
for this particular insect attacked forest canopy and compare the
formulations against the literature values.

Keywords: Micrometeorology, forest meteorology, wind, eddy covariance, turbulence

Requirements: High-level programming skills, time-series analysis, statistics
