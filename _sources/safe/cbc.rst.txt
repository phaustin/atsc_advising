Every year CBC holds a competition for a summer internship that
provides travel costs, $600/week and a $2000 completion bonus for work
in their Toronto studio from May to August, 2014 with the possibility
of a permanent position in September 2014.

UBC Atmospheric Science students in the final year of their program
are eligible to apply.  If you don't fit that description, it is still
great practice to pepare a cover letter and a resume. Roland and I would
be happy to read and critique them, and it's good to have a deadline
to concentrate your efforts.   You can get coaching on resume preparation
at the `UBC Career Center <http://www.students.ubc.ca/careers/index.cfm>`_
I am also happy to read and comment on draft cover letters and resumes,
I just need two days lead time to get comments back to you.

**Deadline:**  Email Dr. Andreas Christen ( andreas.christen@ubc.ca )  your final resume and 
cover letter by **5 pm on Friday October 11**.  If you are planning to apply,
it would be good to let Andreas know ahead of time so he can be watching for
your application.
