_ENGL 112 is recommended. Qualified students are encouraged to consider ENGL 120 and/or 121. Three credits of 1st-year English may be deferred until 2nd year.
 _Students without Physics 12 must take PHYS 100 prior to PHYS 101 or 121. Then take PHYS 102 (or 122) in 2nd year.
_Nine credits must be either Science courses from outside the major field, or Arts courses. The major field includes  ATSC(all), EOSC(fluid courses including those numbered *0*, *1*,*7* and *8*), GEOG(Sci.), and PHYS(all).; 
_Students may choose courses so as to build a knowledge in an area of study related to ATSC. Some suggestions are: * Oceanography track (EOSC 371,  372, 477), * Chemistry track (CHEM   201 and 302), * Computer Science track  (CPSC 128, 216), or * Electronics track (ELEC 263, 366, 485).
_18 credits of electives must be numbered 300  or higher.
_Selected from ATSC 406 (practicum course), ATSC 409 (numerical techniques), CHEM 302 (Atmospheric Chemistry), GEOG 401 (Urban Meteor.), GEOG 402 (Air Pollution), EOSC 352 (Continuum Mechanics), EOSC 354 (Geophys.Time Series), ATSC 414 (geophysical fluid dynamics), PHYS 314 (Fluids).
_If you wish to take ATSC 409 as one of your ATSC electives you will have to take it in this term.
_Students without Biology 11 or 12 must take 3 credits of 100-level biology.
_Recommended electives: EOSC 100-level or GEOG 102.
_Six credits total may be in any faculty.
_Selected from ATSC 406, 409, 414, EOSC 354, GEOG 401, 402
_If you wish to take EOSC 354 as an ATSC elective take in one of these two terms.
