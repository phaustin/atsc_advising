  information:

  Office: GEOG 132

  preparation information.

  - `Atmospheric Science Program official calendar entry <http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=12,215,410,416>`_

+ For 2013 we have replaced GEOB 304 (Synoptic Meteorology) with
  ATSC 406 (Operational Meteorology).  We are proposing that
  this change be made permanent.  We anticipate that we will
  offer ATSC 406 in Fall 2014, but Spring 2015 is also possibility.
  We strongly advise taking ATSC 406 in Jan 2014 -- contact Phil Austin
  if that causes difficulties.

+ Course planning: things to watch out for:

  - The most common issue facing students who want to graduate on time
    is the requirement that students have taken
    `48 upper level credits <http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=12,215,410,1466>`_

  - Another source of glitches are the 
    `Biology requirement <http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=12,215,410,1465>`_  and the `Breadth requirement <http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=12,215,410,1464>`_

  - Note that some courses overlap so much you can't get credit for both.  These
    are listed on the `credit exclusion list <http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=12,215,410,414>`_


  - We will distribute a spreadsheet that will allow you to double check
    that you have a course plan that will allow you to graduate on time.
    (All declared majors will get an email about this).  It will be based on
    this `draft document for geoglogy majors <GEOL-MAJOR_13W.pdf>`_
