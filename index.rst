Degree Navigator
++++++++++++++++

`Degree Navigator <http://science.ubc.ca/students/degree-navigator>`_
a new tool to check whether you are on track to satisfy degree requirements for
graduation.  The website has a couple of short videos -- if you've got
questions email me at paustin@eos.ubc.ca



Planning templates
++++++++++++++++++

We have prepared a course checklist in pdf and docx format for ATSC majors that can be used to make sure you are fulfilling
your degree requirements.    Put in the courses you have taken and are planning to take and
add up your credits to see whether your schedule meets UBC, Science, and ATSC requirements.  Because
several required courses are offered only every other year, there are two different templates:

+ If you declared your major and took ATSC 201 in an even year (2014, 2016, etc.)  then download
  use the `even year pdf template <documents/ATSC_MAJOR_JUNE_2014_even.pdf>`_  or the
  `even year docx template <documents/ATSC_MAJOR_JUNE_2015_even.docx>`_

+ If you declared your major and took ATSC 201 in an odd year (2013, 2015, etc.)
  then download use the `odd year pdf template <documents/ATSC_MAJOR_JUNE_2014_odd.pdf>`_  or the
  `odd year docx template <documents/ATSC_MAJOR_JUNE_2015_odd.docx>`_

Course tables
+++++++++++++

+ Here are sample schedules that show how the requirements can be fulfilled term
  by term over four years:

  + `Even year start (ATSC 201 in 2014, 2016, etc) <requirements/even.html>`_
  
  + `Odd year start (ATSC 201 in 2013, 2015, etc) <requirements/odd.html>`_
