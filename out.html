<p>Atmospheric Science</p>
<p>Undergraduate specializations in Atmospheric Science and the Diploma in Meteorology are offered cooperatively by the Department of Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences and the Department of Geography. Students should direct enquiries to the Associate Chair of Atmospheric Science. For information concerning the diploma program see Diploma in Meteorology.</p>
<p><strong>The Major specialization in Atmospheric Science is available for students with a broad interest in the Earth’s atmosphere</strong>. Students who wish to pursue a professional career as an atmospheric scientist should consider graduate study leading to advanced degrees; see graduate Atmospheric Science. For more information, visit Atmospheric Science.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Co-operative Education Option</p>
<p><strong>This option integrates academic study with relevant supervised work experience. The work placements are arranged by mutual agreement between the students and the employing organizations. Enrolment is limited. Admission is by application to the Science Co-op Office in February prior to third year. Selection will be based on previous academic performance and general suitability to the work environment as assessed by resumé and interview. Admissibility to a third-year Atmospheric Science Bachelor of Science specialization is prerequisite for admission to the Co-op Option but applicants can apply to Co-op before admission to the third-year atmospheric science specializations. Graduation from the Co-op program requires completion of four work terms, the normal courses required for the specialization. Detailed information is available from Atmospheric Sciences or the `Co-operative Education Office &lt;http://www.sciencecoop.ubc.ca/home/contact&gt;`__.</strong></p>

<p><sup>1</sup> For a full list of acceptable courses see Communication Requirement. ENGL 112 is recommended. Qualified students are encouraged to consider ENGL 120 and/or 121. Three credits of the Communication Requirement may be deferred until second year.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup> Students without Physics 12 must take PHYS 100 <strong>prior to other physics courses</strong>. Qualified students are encouraged to take PHYS 107/108/109. <strong>Students are advised to take PHYS 117 in second year if they did not take it or PHYS 107 in first year.</strong></p>
<p><sup>3</sup> Surplus elective credit taken in first or second year can be applied to third or fourth year as elective credit. At least 18 credits of electives must be numbered 300 or higher. Electives must be selected to ensure that there are at least 18 credits of coursework from the Faculty of Arts, including Arts credits used to satisfy the Faculty of Science Communication Requirement.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup> 3 credits of electives must be upper level science. 9 credits must be science courses from outside the major field, or Arts. The major field is defined in the Breadth Requirement table.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup> Students without Biology 11 or 12 must take 3 credits of 100-level BIOL.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup> MATH 180 or 184 or 120 may substitute for any of the specified differential calculus courses listed by decreasing the electives by 1 credit. MATH 110 may substitute for any of the specified differential calculus courses listed by decreasing the electives by 3 credits.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup> MATH 121 may substitute for any of the specified integral calculus courses listed by decreasing the electives by 1 credit.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup> Usually only offered every other year. Check timing with the advisor and plan accordingly.</p>
<p><strong>:sup:`9` Students wishing to pursue a career in weather forecasting or to prepare for graduate study in Atmospheric Science should consult with an ATSC advisor regarding choices of electives, including additional courses in Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, Statistics or Computer Science.</strong></p>

<p><strong>*Statement of Academic Integrity*:</strong></p>
<p><strong>*NOTE: All instructors have been asked to include the following type
of statement of Academic Integrity in their course outlines distributed
to students.*</strong></p>
<p><em>The academic enterprise is founded on honesty, civility, and integrity.
As members of this enterprise, all students are expected to know,
understand, and follow the codes of conduct regarding academic
integrity. At the most basic level, this means submitting only original
work done by you and acknowledging all sources of information or ideas
and attributing them to others as required. This also means you should
not cheat, copy, or mislead others about what is your work. Violations
of academic integrity (i.e., misconduct) lead to the breakdown of the
academic enterprise, and therefore serious consequences arise and harsh
sanctions are imposed. For example, incidences of plagiarism or cheating
may result in a mark of zero on the assignment or exam and more serious
consequences may apply if the matter is referred to the President’s
Advisory Committee on Student Discipline. Careful records are kept in
order to monitor and prevent recurrences.</em></p>
